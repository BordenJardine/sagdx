##What Is this?
This is our entry into the tenth Something Awful Game Dev Challenge.

Cinder is bizarre HTML5 microgame fest with an internet dating theme.

This is a **Smart Phone** game. While technically playable in any modern browser, it totally sucks on anything but a smart phone.

[Play it Here!](http://bordenjardine.github.io/sagdx/)


##Running it on your computer
To run this locally you need nodejs.

In this directory:
```
npm install
bower install
npm start
```

then point your phone's browser to `YOUR.COMPUTERS.IP:9000` while your phone and computer are on the same wifi network.
